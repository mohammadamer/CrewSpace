# API

The API is versioned under `/api/v1` and uses DTO validation, server-side authentication, Workspace membership checks, and typed error responses.

Phase 1 endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /auth/register`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `POST /auth/logout`
- `POST /auth/session`
- `GET /workspaces`
- `POST /workspaces`
- `GET /workspaces/:workspaceId`

Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <session>`. Tenant-owned data is always resolved through the authenticated User's Workspace membership.
